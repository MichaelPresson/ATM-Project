# ATM-Project
ATM Project
This is a project that has a webpage with functionality similar to an ATM machine where you can select "Deposit" or "Cash Back" and determine the amount with a number input and submit input. 
I added the additional functionality of not allowing the cash back option if the funds weren't sufficient to cover the withdrawal. I also added some styling with red indicating cash back and green indicating deposit on the dropdown input.
